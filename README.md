# TestTask_1
Definition: A string that begins and ends with a vowel letter (aeiouAEIOU) is a vowel string, and the number of mixed non-vowel letters is its defect degree. for example:
"a" and "aa" are vowel strings, and their imperfections are both 0
"aiur" is not a vowel string (not a vowel character at the end)
"abira" is a vowel string with a blemish degree of 2
Given a string, find the longest vowel substring with the specified flaw degree, and output its length, if no vowel substring that satisfies the condition is found, output 0.

(Substring: A subsequence composed of any number of consecutive characters in a string is called a substring of the string.)
